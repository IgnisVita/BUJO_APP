# 🎯 Remember

**The goal isn't to build a bullet journal app. The goal is to build the most beautiful, intuitive digital journal that happens to have bullet journal features.**

Every decision should be filtered through:
1. Is it beautiful?
2. Is it intuitive?
3. Does it spark joy?
4. Would I use this daily?
5. Does this work for everything from finance to fitness and project management?

If the answer to any of these is no, iterate until it's yes.
